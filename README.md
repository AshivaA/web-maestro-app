# Project Name: web-maestro-app

## TEAM NAME: Team Vanilla

## Project Name (Options): webMaestro.

  ** Elevator Pitch:
We have come up with an ingenious
web product , which in itself a
solution to the problem that most
bootcamp students face, having to
rack their brains for relevant after
class study materials that takes into
account various learning styles such
as visual learning, etc, as well as
incorporates a note-taking section
while learning.
This is a Software App solution that
presents web links to for students to
be able to add learning resources
and tutorial videos from Youtube and
Reddit as recommended by the Tas
and organized based on subject. It
offers students flexibility and
proximity to their external learning
resources while taking away the
stress of searching endlessly for
materials on the web.

## 1. About the Web Maestro app

        The Project considers the fact that,
        as people are different, so do they also
        learn differently. Also, it brings
        learning resources to you rather than
        you going in an endless search for
        them.
        Upon logging into the App, the user
        is greeted with an interface to select
        their particular learning style, after
        which they are presented with
        resources after the manner of 
        such selected style.

## USER STORY

        AS A UoB Front-End Bootcamp student,
        I WANT to find learning resources on
        covered content includingGit/GitHub, VsCode set up, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and APIs with ease,
        SO THAT I can devote more time to
        learning rather than searching.

## Acceptance Criteria:

        GIVEN that I am a UoB Bootcamp student
        WHEN I want to study after classes
        THEN I log into my account in my
        “study guide” app (User authentication)
        THEN I chose from a list of
        sequentially arranged topics
        THEN I chose my preferred learning
        style
        WHEN a topic is selected
        THEN I am redirected to an external
        learning resource
        THEN I am also able to take notes
        while studying
